    Allows `cleanup_auth_data` and ops tooling to purge expired refresh
    mappings with a single indexed filter instead of joining against
    `OutstandingToken`. Nullable so existing rows stay valid without a
    data backfill — they'll be pruned by the generic blacklist/revoked
    paths until they're replaced on the next refresh.
